\usage{
E.step(alpha, beta, gamma, data, min.detect, event)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{vector of intercepts where each entry is the intercept for one species/event combination}

\item{beta}{slope vector with one entry per FIB species, which indicates the marginal increase in that species' log-mean for a unit increase in the contamination index}

\item{gamma}{contamination vector with one entry per row of data, indicating the contamination index for the corresponding row}

\item{data}{matrix of FIB counts with one row per sample and one column per FIB species}

\item{min.detect}{minimum detectable level of the FIB assay - counts below this threshold are censored}

\item{event}{vector with one entry per row of data where each entry indicates the event with which the data row is associated}
}
\value{
A matrix of FIB counts, where the censored counts are replaced by their expectations under the current parameters.
}
\description{
Replace censored values by their expectations of censored FIB counts
under the current parameter values, conditional on the counts being
below the minimum level of detection.
}
\details{
This function imputes the expectations of censored data values and
replaces the censored observations by their expectations, conditional on
the censored values being below the minimum level of detection.
The expectation is with respect to a Poisson
distribution. It is calculated via the estimated parameters
\eqn{(\hat{\mathbf{\alpha}}, \hat{\mathbf{\beta}}, \hat{\mathbf{\gamma}})}
through the relationship
\deqn{\eta = \alpha + \beta \gamma}
\deqn{Y ~ Poisson(\exp(\eta)).}

Let \eqn{c_j} be the minimum level of detection for column \eqn{j} of the
data, and suppose that observation \eqn{Y_{ij}} is censored, meaning that
our only knowledge of \eqn{Y_{ij}} is that \eqn{Y_{ij} < c_j}. Then the
conditional expectation \eqn{E (Y_{ij} | Y_{ij} < c_j)} is
\deqn{E (Y_{ij} | Y_{ij} < c_j) \sum_{k=1}^c_j \{ k \lambda_{ij}^k
    \exp (-\lambda_{ij}) \Gamma(k+1)^{-1} \} / \{ \sum_{k=1}^n
    \lambda_{ij}^k \exp (-\lambda_{ij}) \Gamma(k+1)^{-1} \},}
where \eqn{\lambda_{ij} = \alpha_{ij} + \beta_j \gamma_i}, \eqn{\alpha_{ij}}
is the intercept for observation \eqn{i}, bacteria species \eqn{j},
\eqn{\beta_j} is the slope for bacteria species \eqn{j} (meaning that
\eqn{\beta_j} is the marginal increase in expected long-concentration of
species \eqn{j} when the contamination increases by one unit), and
\eqn{\gamma_i} is the contamination index of observation \eqn{i}.
