Description: The latent package is used to estimate the parameters of a latent variable model for several Poisson random variables. There are options for requiring a zero-intercept with some of the columns, for setting a left-censoring value for each column of data, and for assigning each row to an event, in which case a unique intercept is set for each unique combination of event and column.
